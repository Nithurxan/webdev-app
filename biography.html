  <h1>Nithursan Balarankan - Biography</h1>
  <p>I was born on November 13, 2004, in Scarborough, Canada, and spent most of my life in Flemingdon Park. In 2020, during the lockdown, my family and I moved to Ajax.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, I am pursuing studies in computer programming and analysis. My goal is to transition to a university for further education in computer engineering. Eventually, I aspire to find a job in the field and continue studying while gaining practical experience. Ultimately, I hope to establish my own business or company.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of academics, I have a keen interest in fitness and enjoy spending time at the gym.</p>
